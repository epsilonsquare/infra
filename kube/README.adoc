== ArgoCD

Everything running on Kubernetes is deployed with ArgoCD except for ArgoCD
itself. `kube/argocd/` contains a kustomization that can be applied to the
Kubernetes cluster to deploy ArgoCD as follows.

[source,bash]
----
kustomize build kube/argocd | kubectl --context=e2-admin apply -f -
----

TODO: Ideally, this should be done by Terraform but that implies connecting to
the VPN or using an SSH tunnel since the Kube apiserver is not accessible from
outside.
